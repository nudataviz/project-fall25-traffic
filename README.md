# Traffic Project

This repository contains our Fall 2025 data visualization project built with the Observable Framework.

The project explores traffic flow and lane-merging behavior through interactive visualizations and simulations. Users can adjust traffic parameters and compare different merging strategies to better understand their impact on congestion and flow stability.

The final project is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed here:
