# Proposal

## Project

**Name:** LaneMerge Simulation  

**Story:**  
On many multi-lane roads, traffic often merges into a single lane at intersections. Some drivers merge early, while others cut in at the last moment, causing congestion and long waiting times. We propose simulating a rule change where drivers must merge 100 meters before the traffic light (with a $200 fine for violations) to test whether orderly merging improves traffic flow and reduces waiting time.  

**Stakeholder:**  
- **Drivers:** directly affected by merging behavior and road regulations, seeking shorter commute times and smoother traffic flow.  
- **Traffic management authorities:** responsible for setting road rules, enforcing penalties, and improving overall traffic conditions.

## Data

We will generate simulation data representing traffic flow under two scenarios: (1) current random merging behavior, and (2) regulated early merging with penalties.  
The dataset will include parameters such as car length, following distance, acceleration, lane count, and signal timing.  

Since real-world lane merging data are not directly available, this project will use synthetic data created in Python for visualization.  
Possible risk: simulated assumptions may not fully capture real driver behavior.
