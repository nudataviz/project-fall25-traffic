# EDA — LaneMerge Simulation

## Figures Illustrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

At this stage, the EDA focuses on understanding the **synthetic data** generated by the simulation script `simulate_basic.py`.  
Although I have not yet created visual plots, the dataset itself contains the key numerical variables for analysis, including:
- `arrival_time` — the moment each car reaches the merging area.  
- `wait_time` — how long each car waits before passing through.  
- `departure_time` — when each car finishes passing the intersection.  
- `scenario` — whether the car belongs to the *Early Merge* or *Late Merge* condition.  

From this data, future visualizations (to be built in Observable Framework) will likely include:
1. A histogram comparing the distribution of waiting times between the two scenarios.  
2. A boxplot summarizing variability and median waiting times.  
3. A time-series view of how average waiting time evolves over the simulation period.  

These plots will help visually demonstrate how the **Early Merge** strategy reduces congestion compared to **Late Merge**.

## Description of Results

Preliminary numerical results (from the Python simulation) show that:
- The **average waiting time** for *Early Merge* vehicles is substantially lower than for *Late Merge* vehicles.  
- The **standard deviation** and **90th percentile** waiting times are also much smaller in the *Early Merge* case, meaning drivers experience more stable and predictable flow.  
- In contrast, *Late Merge* leads to large fluctuations — some cars move quickly, while others wait much longer due to frequent last-minute merging.  

These findings support the hypothesis that enforcing early lane merging can significantly improve both **efficiency** and **fairness** in traffic flow.

## Unanticipated Challenges / Risks to Project Success

1. **Accuracy of simulation data:**  
   Since the dataset is synthetic, it may not fully represent real-world driver behavior, such as hesitation, reaction time, or external factors like signal cycles.

2. **Parameter sensitivity:**  
   Small changes in parameters (e.g., average service time or merging delay) can greatly affect overall results, requiring sensitivity analysis.

3. **Visualization complexity:**  
   Implementing dynamic, interactive visualization in the Observable Framework is a next challenge — especially for animating time-based traffic flow smoothly.

### Next Steps

- Add traffic-light timing to make the simulation more realistic.  
- Visualize both scenarios dynamically using the Observable Framework (`Plot` + `Inputs.play`).  
- Compare additional indicators such as queue length or throughput per cycle.
